Description: The depth-averaged 2D hydrodynamic model is further modified by introducing treatment technology of wet-dry boundary and considering vegetation effects base on a two-dimensional numerical model for hydrodynamics and sediment transport (HydroSed2D). 

# Prerequisite Software and data
(1) Mesh generator （Gmsh is used in present model）

(2) Fortran language compiler

(3) Data post-processing software, e.g., Matlab, Tecplot, Microsoft office
# Model operation
(1) Users can download the program file by clicking "Download ZIP" option in "Clone or download" under "Code" Title.

(2) Before running progarm, users need to build a "input" file which contaians "ctr.dat" and "untitled.msh" provided under "Code" Title, and a "result " file which stores output results.

(3) Users can click main program “swefvm.dsw” and enter the compilation environment to modify computer code and execute the program. The option “!” is used to execute the file.

# Model application
The computer code under "Code" Title is used to simulate tsunami propagation on a real-scale vegetated beach. Present numerical  are validated by three experimental cases of dam-break flow in a dry channel with a hump, solitary wave through a vegetated channel, tsunami wave run-up in Monai Valley. The setting of corresponding conditions in computer code for these three experimental cases can be found in Subtitle "branch" under Title "Code"
