Novelty: The depth-averaged 2D hydrodynamic model is further modified by introducing treatment technology of wet-dry boundary and considering vegetation effects base on a two-dimensional numerical model for hydrodynamics and sediment transport (HydroSed2D). 

# Prerequisite software and data
(1) Mesh generator （Gmsh is used in present model）

(2) Fortran language compiler （Present computer code is modified on Compaq Visual Fortran 6.5 by authors）

(3) Data post-processing software, e.g., Matlab, Tecplot, Microsoft office
# Model operation
(1) Users can download the program file by clicking Option "Download ZIP" in "Clone or download" under Title "Code".

(2) Before running program, users need to build a new "input" folder which contains "ctr.DAT" file and "untitled.MSH" file provided in Title "Code", and a "result " folder which is used for storing output results.

(3) Users can click main program “swefvm.dsw” and enter the compilation environment to modify computer code and execute the program. The Option “!” is used to execute the program.

# Model application
The computer code under Title "Code" is used to simulate tsunami propagation on a real-scale vegetated beach. Present numerical  are validated by three experimental cases of dam-break flow in a dry channel with a hump (3.1), solitary wave through a vegetated channel (3.2) and tsunami wave run-up in Monai Valley (3.3). The setting of corresponding conditions in computer code for these three experimental cases can be found in Subtitle "branch" under Title "Code".
